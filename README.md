## **Research on light**
angle of incidence is the angle of which the directed light source is pointed at the normal
critical angle is the angle of the ray when the light reflected is at 90 degrees

### Refraction 
![Alt text](imgs/light1.png)
first diagram is when angle of incidence < criticle angle, so when it moves to a new medium, it refracts (break/tilt)

### critical angle
![Alt text](imgs/light2.png)
Second is when angle of incidence = crit angle so no refraction

### total internal reflection
![Alt text](imgs/light3.png)
Third is when angle of incidence > criticdle angle, so  quite literally internally reflected (NOT REFRACTED)

### Formulas 
Refractive Index -->  n = c/v
where n is refractive index,
c is speed of light in vacumm / air
v is speed of light in Medium / Acrylic

Snell's law
n1 sin x1 = n2 sin x2
where n1 == incident Refractive Index
where n2 == refracted Refractive Index

where x1 == incident angle
where x2 == refracted angle

### complilation
![Alt text](imgs/light4.png)
total internal reflection occurs when the ray of incidence's angle is higher than the critical angle

## **Research on Pepper Ghost**

**Basic Understanding**

Illustration technique to exploit virtual images

Used in various areas such as:
  
  * Theatre
  * Cinema
  * Amusement Park
  * Museum
  * Television 
  * Concert
  
How does the illustration work?

  * When the light wabes bounce off from one surface to another, an image is reflected
  * One surface is seen by the audience while the other surface is hidden
  * The glass can be held at a certain angle

Can take less technology compared to hologram

**Contrast**
Contrast ratio is the difference between light and dark on a screen expressed by a number. If you take the brightest white on a screen and the darkest black and compare the luminosity, you will get the contrast ratio. Unlike brightness which is the amount of light your eyes perceive from the projected image. Contrast is the difference between the brighter and darker portions of the projected image. The contrast ratio best suited for the pepper ghost effect is the highest possible contrast setting on the given device, be it a projector or monitor. Reason for such is that the most optimal environment for the pepper ghost effect is a dark room void of other sources of light shining directly on the pepper ghost, since the contrast ratio is between the brightest and darkest part of the projected image, a higher contrast will enhance the central focus of the projection while concurrently making the background less obvious. An example would be if one wishes to project an image of a fish with a black background, with a high contrast, it would seem like the fish is the only thing projected on the acrylic while simultaneously making the black background less visible, giving the illusion of the fish floating in midair seamlessly.

**Brightness**

Contains properties of the clear vision for reconstruction from the source of light which extends the vertical view of the aperture of the scene depth

Colour of the hologram components consist of the array of the noncontiguous of small dots along with thin strips

Changing image formatting brightness along with the image formatting contrast enhance the encode of the hologram

For example, higher makes the 3D images more predictable 

The brightness of the hologram could also depend on the brightness from the projector
