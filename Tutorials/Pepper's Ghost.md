Using a sturdy and heavy enough frame, mount the projector to the underside of the frame, then angle the projector 10° towards the floor.

Then, at 100cm away, prop up the white polyfoam, and tilt it backwards to an angle of 68°.

Above the frame, place and open the acrylic, then secure it while angling it at 75°
